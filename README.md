# bruh-sort
Sorting algorithm using POSIX system calls

## how does it work ?

Compile using the gcc compiler 

```sh
gcc sort.c -o sort -Wall -Werror
```
```sh
gcc sleep.c -o sleep -Wall -Werror
```

Then run the run the program with a list of positive integers as arguments. (negative integers support coming soon)

```sh
./sort 9 8 7 6 5 3 4 1 2 0
```
